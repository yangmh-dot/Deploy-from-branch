  "prompt_en": "(0-3 seconds) A hyper-realistic, 8K vertical video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. The scene opens with a smooth, cinematic tracking shot, moving slowly across the interior of a dirty microwave. Bright, clinical lighting reveals splatters of old tomato sauce, greasy residue, and caked-on food particles. The background is a modern, minimalist American kitchen (clean white cabinets, marble countertop), contrasting the messy microwave.\n\n(3-6 seconds) A pair of hands with a flawless light-pink manicure enters. With deliberate, graceful movements, they place a small elegant glass bowl filled with clear water and three vibrant yellow lemon slices onto the center of the turntable. Medium-close shot focusing on the clean hands and the natural cleaning solution.\n\n(6-9 seconds) The microwave door clicks shut. Cut to an exterior shot of a sleek stainless-steel microwave. The digital display lights up and counts down as the interior light glows, illuminating the spinning bowl. Exactly 3 seconds.\n\n(9-14 seconds) The door swings open, releasing a satisfying billow of citrus-scented steam toward the camera. The same manicured hand, now holding a crisp white paper towel, reaches in. In one fluid motion, the towel wipes a heavily soiled surface clean, revealing a sparkling white wall beneath—effortless and magical.\n\n(14-15 seconds) Final static shot of the gleaming, spotless interior. A small lens flare glints off the surface. End on satisfaction and ultimate cleanliness.\n\nOverall directives: 9:16 vertical, 15s duration, bright minimalist high-end aesthetic, hyper-realistic 8K, airy studio lighting, fast instructional editing with sharp, satisfying cuts, mood: satisfying, effortless, magical cleaning hack.",
