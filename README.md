# Life Hack Copy Kit (US Audience)

A zero‑backend, GitHub Pages‑friendly generator for hooks/titles, captions, hashtags, and a polished prompt for lemon‑steam microwave cleaning (and similar life‑hack shorts).

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Download this ZIP and extract it.
2. Create a new GitHub repo (public or private).
3. Upload all files. Commit.
4. Enable **Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch**; choose `main` and `/ (root)`.
5. Open your Pages URL. No API keys required.

## Use
- Click **🎲 Random All** to regenerate copy.
- Copy each column with **Copy** or everything with **Copy All** (separated by `---`).
- Change **Tone** and **Audience** to fit your vibe.
- Everything runs locally in the browser.

## Customization
- Edit `assets/data.json` to add more hooks/lingo/CTAs or replace the default prompt.
- Duplicate this project for other hacks (sink descaler, shower glass, fridge seal, etc.).
